# The politics of ethnic identities: module #3

- **Racial identities = biological features**. Skin colour, hair colour, eye colour, facial feature. Acquired at birth
- **Ethnic = social categories.** Language, culture, cuisine, dress, region, religion.  
- African – more of an ethnic label. Black – racial. Mulatto – racial. Argentinian – ethnic. 

## Are ethnically diverse firms more productive?

- Error by coethnics tend to be correlated (i.e white American impatience, excessive saving of Asian Americans, risk aversion in African Americas)
- Diversity offsets these problems – team becomes more error-proof
- This stem from evolution theory(inbreeding depression) In the economy – racist/sexist firms gradually lose competition
- Ethnic discrimination negatively affects Economic development
- Thus, ethnic discrimination tends to decline w/o political intervention
- Diversity leads to better combination, but does it lead to cooperation

## Ethic with Policies

### Do ethnically diverse societies produce more public goods?

- **2 types of ethnic policy**: melting pot (discrimination/assimilation)
- Salad bowl – (multiculturalism)
- Case: apartheid in south Africa vs multicultural brazil. They have many similarities(economy, demographics, geopolitics). Both started as ineffective states.  South Africa was much better at collecting taxes and providing public services.
- Income tax collection require cooperation among the **rich**, and cooperation between **rich and the poor**. People are more willing to cooperate when they have a shared and **coherent** identity.

### Benefit of a coherent identity: 
  - **self interest**: common identity heightens shared economic interests. Individuals derive “psychic” benefits from status of their group. 
  - **Altruism**: Individuals are willing to sacrifice for members of their own group.
  - **efficient**: same language and culture makes coordination easier. 

### What makes an identity coherent?

- Identity is a classification scheme – it serves to differentiate one group from another
- **The principle of negation** states that for an identity to be meaningful, at least one individual must classify as not belonging. The more sharply outsiders are excluded, the more coherent the insiders’ shared identity. The more permissively outsiders are included, the less coherent the insiders’ shared identity.
- Implication:
  - **A policy of salad bowl will weaken shared identities, intensify conflicting identities**
  - **A policy of melting pot will sharpen shared identity amongst elites and outcasts.**

#### Impact on public services/collective action/taxes

- A policy of salad bowl will – weaken shared identity for every one. **impede cooperation on collective action, impede tax collection and reduce public services.** (elite do not wish to help the poor. Multi-ethnic elites free ride on each other)
- A policy of melting pot will – sharpen shared identity among elites and among outcast. **enhance collective action amongst elites (South African whites willing to pay taxes to help poor whites). This will enhance collective action amongst outcasts too – black mobilization of equal rights**

#### The failure of soviet communism due to ethnic identities

- Example of the **perverse effect of salad bowl**
- Communists had sharply different fates in different countries (heavy defeats un Ukraine, Georgia. Popular in Belarus, moldova)
- Initial Problem was ethnic – local resentment towards foreign communism. Soviet leaders need to forge common "Soviet identity". Solution: forced assimilation vs multiculturalism. 
- Soviet leaders chose **multiculturalism**. Pre-communist ethnic curriculum was continued and supported. 
- However**, this violated the principle of negation. No ethnic category was classified as "not being" Soviet. The soviet identity loses coherence.** 
- Consequence – in regions with **high pre-communist literacy rates, native identity crowd out soviet identity**, communist support collapsed. In regions with low pre-communist literacy rates, there was no pre-existing native identity, soviet identity unchallenged, communist support sustained.

## Recap

In economy

- Ethnic discrimination reduces economic competitiveness. Diversity prevents systematic errors
- Thus in the case of economy, ethnic diversity is good. 

In politics

- Ethnic discrimination encourages collective action, due to intensifying group identities. Also encourages members to make sacrifices for their identity (pay taxes, join army, etc.)
- Ethnic inclusion weakens collective identity, impedes collective sacrifice.

## Is racism/melting pot always better than multiculturalism?

- **Fundamental Logic: negation -> collective identity -> collective efforts to protect identity**
- **Positive consequence** – group members **embrace tasks** that bring **honour** to their identity (pay taxes, join army, etc.)
- **Negative consequence** – group members **deny problems** that bring **stigma** to identity (denying poverty issues within community, believing they are too proud)

### Case study: HIV/AIDs pandemic in brazil/south Africa

- Brazil was much more proactive than south Africa.  Brazil was also much more successful.  
- How did this happen?
- **Under ethnic discrimination**: **group identities are strong. The blame for social problems targeted at specific groups. Targeting creates stigma for the problem group. To safeguard collective identity, the problem group mobilize to deny problem, actively refuse help**. i.e (blacks targeted during the HIV crisis, they deny help, deny the crisis existed).
- **Under ethnic inclusiveness: group identities are weak, thus, people perceive problems to be shared/pooled across groups. Stigma loses meaning without targeting, as pooling drives out stigma. Culprits are understood as victims. All individuals acknowledge problem and seek help.**

### Case study: Hindu

- Hindu heartland controls most legislative seats(hence government). 
- Government discriminates against non-hindus
- Ethnic discrimination sharpens Hindu identity
- Hindu-based government denies AIDS problem -blames northeast for drug use, blame southern states for promiscuity

## How do individuals choose ethnic identity

- **Ethnicity** has many dimensions. Which dimension should voters/politicians exploit in politics
- Puzzle: how do people choose votes in American? – an English speaking catholic latino in LA has 3 choices in playing the ethnic card (language, religion, skin colour) - Could mobilize fellow catholics against other faiths, mobilize English vs non-english, or mobilize fellow latinos
- Voters can split over either large or small ethnic dimensions
  - India – they split over caste in 1910s, now they split over religion (muslim vs hindu)
  - Kenya: voter split over tribes/clans under one-party rule, languages under multi-party rule
  - Northern Ireland: religions
- **the ethnic coalition has to be large enough to win power,  but small enough to minimize the sharing of resources with others**. **Politicians/voters always choose the minimum-winning coalition.** 
  - They will focus on latinos(50%) as they want an ethnic coalition that is large enough to win, but small enough to keep the costs as low.
  - English speaking population too high – cost too high
  - Catholic population too low – cannot win. 
- Logic: want to have the most chances of winning (mobilize the highest population), and most cheaply (least cost per person) – it’s not just about numbers. 
- This is referred to as a minimum winning coalition 
- People sometimes choose to portray their ethnic identity differently at different times. 
- Voters in many countries split over tribes/clans under one party rules
- They split over languages under multi-party competition. 
- Why do politicians/voters build different types of ethnic coalitions

## Conditions to a minimum-winning ethnic coalition. 

- 1) how large is the arena for political competition. 
- 2) how large is the ethnic coalition (large = language, religion) or small (clans, tribes, etc.)
- Small coalitions are nested within large ones. Large coalitions cover more population
- If the arena for political competition is large (i.e national election)
- A small coalition cannot win – as the population of the coalition is too small.  
- In this case, the voters/politicians will focus on the large coalitions. 
- In a local competition, a large ethnic coalition covers large percentages of population -> oversized
- Voters/politicians will focus on small coalitions in this case

## When is political competition national or local

- Under a one-party regime, power at a national level is uncontested. Dominant part fields competing candidates in local ridings. Competition is local. Ethnicity evolves around small coalitions. 
- Under multi-party regimes, power is contested at a national level. Competition is national, ethnicity evolves around large coalitions. 
- i.e in kenya, ethnic identities shifted from languages to clans after opposition parties were banned. 
- Under countries where the ability to vote is limited by education/race/income, parties now compete for votes from the elites
- Elites are generally highly homogeneous in terms of large ethnic dimensions. This is too big – an oversized winning coalition, too much resource cost. 
- Thus, politicians and voters exploit small ethnic dimensions in this case (i.e clans, tribes)
- This is the opposite for countries with near-universal suffrage.  – politicians/voters now exploit large ethnic dimensions (i.e language, religion) in this case
- This is in order to ensure that they have large enough coalition to meet the minimum winning coalition. Small clans/tribes are not large enough in population to be winning. They are now non-winning. 

# Module 4 – Logic of life under authoritarian regimes

## what are authoritarian regimes?

* population excluded from **selecting the leader**
  * excluded from participation China- no general election
  * excluded from choice - NK
* Population deprived of **influence on leader behaviour**
  * leader can act unconstrained, leading to grand gesture - China's water dam
* **Typology** of Authoritarian Regime- based on ruler's background, ignore the social/economic stuff
  * **Monarchy** - rulers are members of dynastic family - Jordan, UAE, Saudi Arabia 
  * **Military** - rulers are active duty soldiers, came into power through coup - Burma, Park Chung-hee, Pinochet
  * **One-party-rule** - rulers of dominant party - communist countries, Egypt under Mubarak, Chavez

## How do authoritarian regimes maintain power?

- the repressive power of autocratic leader comes not from the person but the organization 
- **Repression relies on effective coercive organization**
  1. **well-coordinated bureaucracy** (deuestche bank send an invoice to the Nazi regime on the persecution of Jewish people, and if the Nazi government pay their bill late the service will be cut off)
  2. **deep resources** ( Uyghur vs big government car )
  3. **massive manpower**
- dictators rely on elites from the coercive organization - secret police, etc
- threat to dictators comes not from masses, but fellow ruling elites
  - by brothers in monarchies, by lower-ranking soldiers
- **Dictator's security dilemma**
  - long term(mass revolt) and short term( palace coup)
  - long term security puts dictators in greater immediate danger
- dictator's survival relies on coalition of fellow elites, these elites create dictators "**wining coalition**"
  - family members in monarchies, soldiers, party members
- Dictators primary task is to **keep the winning coalition from defecting**
  - repression-> infeasible, elites control the coercive system
  - **clientelism**-> offer resources to buy elites' support by offering privileges
    - public goods: Non-excludable, elites defecting from the winning coalition still have access to the goods
    - private goods: excludable, defecting elites can be denied access. i.e luxuries, policy favours, appointments in key positions
- elite support for dictators is based on negotiation and exchange

### Who holds short side power in authoritarian societies? 

- members of the wining coalition receive exclusive private goods
- All citizens want to join the winning coalition.
- However in dictatorship winning coalition is very small
- Applicants vastly outnumber available posts in the winning coalition
- Dictator exercise short side power over elites

**Reverse Competition**

- In an authoritarian government, the citizens vie to curry favour from the state

- In a democratic government, the state vies for favour from the citizens. 

**Short side power explains population loyalty in authoritarian regimes**

* Population need not be coerced, or deceived
* It is in their self-interest to support the regime

#### Competition amongst population has unintended consequences

- Winners are based on their **relative rankings**, rather than their **actual skill level.** 

- Focusing on relative difference in effort, contestants ignore its absolute level

  * When it comes to competition, a very frequent outcome is overshooting – this is the tournament effect
  * Marginal increase in effort has disproportionate impact in winning the competition
  * This motivates all people to keep ratcheting up efforts

- Population’s enthusiasm overshoots the dictators preferences – people compete too enthusiastically with each other. 

##### Example: the great leap forward

- Why such extreme grain output diversion? Competition amongst locals for political favours.Focusing on relative ranking in grain contribution, cadres ignore absolute magnitude of local starvation.

- - why did it vary sharply across provinces?Provinces with vacant party positions suffered extreme food removal.  Provinces without upward mobility escaped famine

- Policy overshooting – is caused competition among population. 

#### short side power leads to policy drift

##### Example: class enemies

- Why would one kill their neighbors(intimate). Remember – the original objective was to re-educate class enemies. Local competition led to innovation in target – non-class enemies are targeted. Citizens falsely accuse each other, in order to settle personal scores. wars civilians engage in collaboration for personal revenge

- why concentrated in rural areas? Leader’s objective: re-educate class enemies.Competition among locals led to innovation in technique: elimination.Areas out of reach from the center suffer most killings


- Recap: Dictator’s repressive strength turns into weakness: 
- Repressive Power
  - dictators become reliant on fellow elites, and thus are vulnerable to palace coups. 

* Bargaining Power
    * Since everyone want to join the winning coalition, as population competes to please the leader, and thus can cause policy overshooting, or policy drifting. 

## How are democratic and autocratic regimes similar?

- Some autocratic regimes have elements in them that are democratic in nature. 
- Why do dictators maintain democratic institutions
- To increase mass support, dictators allow more citizens to join the winning coalition
- Members of the winning coalition receive benefits as private goods
- However, private goods are rivalrous, and thus the more people you have the more competition there is. When membership becomes large, each member has less to share.
- This is not the case for public goods such as those presented in a non-clientelistic society, the amount of public good is still the same regardless of population. 
- When winning coalition membership is large in a dictatorship, masses no longer value membership
- In response, dictators offer public goods as concessions to the coalition, making it seem more like a democratic institution.
- Dictators with large winning coalitions offer more policy concessions in the form of public goods.
- Intuition: larger winning coalition → private goods value per person dissipates, but this is not the case for public goods -> dictators start providing public goods. 
- Monarchies/personal rulers – membership brings extreme private goods, due to the small size of the winning coalition.
- Military state – membership brings some privileges, minimum winning coalition is medium size, and thus there is a combination of both private and public goods provided to the coalition. 
- In one-party states, few benefits trickle down to most members (one party states have quite large winning coalitions) I.e china and the CCP. Thus, they are likelier to provide public goods, least feasible to provide private goods. There will be greater attention to good public policy.

## Why do dictators maintain democratic institutions?

help a small ruling group deal with large masses
1. legislature: make policy concession creditable
2. multiple parties: screen week spot in opposition
3. elections: signal strength

## Why have legislature?

- Now: In periods where the masses are strong, the dictator prefers to make policy concessions
- Later: when masses are weak, dictator prefers not to concede.
- Thus,**it is in the dictator’s interest to concede now and renege later**. The masses will thus be skeptical of their changes
- So how does the dictator credibly demonstrate their resolve to not renege on their concessions?- Odysseus: something to bind their hand
- **The dictator invite the legislature to binds their own hand** 
  - More policy concessions -> more binding is required. 
  - Logic: larger winning coalition -> more concessions -> greater temptation to renege -> stronger legislature. The one-party states thus have the most legislative bindings in order to ensure that they adhere to their promises, since they are more dependent on public goods as offering vs private goods.
- Thus, **in monarchies(small wining coalition)- legislature is least likely to be permitted, military regime is in between – not very likely. One party rule – most likely to be permitted**

## Why allow opposition parties?

- The dictator does not know well what the public thinks of them
- He wants to know what types of opposition types exist – **opportunists and radicals.** 
- It is hard to differentiate these types – as everyone would claim that they are radicals.
- Similar to a car insurance company – they want to attract low risk drivers, but it is hard for them to glean information about the type of drivers. The solution: 1. **offer them many options** 2.  **ensure that it is too costly for different types of opposition members to mimic each other’s types**.  high risk driver would not take the maximum deductible policy, low-risk driver will choose zero deductible policy as it has a high monthly payment.
- This is the theory of **screening**-identify the types of other side. (signaling: demonstrate your own type)
- In the scenario of a dictatorship:
  - If opposition parties are all banned, silence is the only option for both radicals and opportunists. **As a result, these two types are indistinguishable.**
  - If opposition parties are allowed, then the opposition can choose between yes and no. 
    - **For the radicals, yes is too costly (they lose reputation).** - vote no
    - **No is too costly for opportunists (they lose bribes from regime).** - vote yes
    - By allowing opposition, the dictator can easily separate the radicals and the opportunists. 

## why many dictatorships have competitive elections

- **Mass** revolt can overthrow the dictator

- **Individual** action has little to no effect

- Individuals will not oppose unless **they know** others will oppose

- If dictators convey impressions of widespread support, no one will want to overthrow the regime, even if there are more than enough of them to topple the regime.

### How do dictators show popularity credibly?
- **They must take an action that is impossible for weak dictators (lemons) to mimic. i.e  the strong dictators will allow for competitive elections**
- This is a credible **signal** of their strength/popularity, as weak dictators cannot afford to hold competitive elections
- That is why many dictatorships have competitive elections – strong dictators want to use elections/referendums to credibly signal popularity
- Example: Putin & election. High approval. Myanmar: refuse to hold elections

### How to avoid the impression of "fraudulent election"?
- Many times, opposition parties do not find it rational to monitor elections honestly.
  - **Radicals** always declare the election fraudulent even in the government wins fairly

  - For the **opportunists**, they will always claim that the election was clean even if the government wins fraudulently – they want to curry favour 

  - Even if fraud is visible, there is disagreement amongst the opposition –Thus, dictators will use this split to their advantage,  avoid clear impression of fraud

- Opposition division in election monitoring can also harm dictators:

  - Even if election is visibly clean, there is no clear perception of cleanness
  - Root cause: radicals will always claim that there is fraud.
  - even a clean election win cannot gain clear impression of cleanness

  - Solution: the dictator **signals** to the public that they are fair – they allow **independent electoral monitoring organizations**. Fraudulent dictators cannot afford to allow this scrutiny, but fair dictators can do so. 

    - I.e in Canada, elections Canada is an independent third-party organization that oversees the elections on an impartial basis

The politics of regime change – 

- in a dictatorship, wealth in unequally distributed
- elites are rich, citizens are poor 
- citizens generally act rationally to increase their standards of life
- Thus, they would push directly for more income. Democracy only offers you procedural benefits.
- Working on this logic, the poor would demand wealth/economic resources from the dictator, rather than initially wanting democracy
- Thus – they will continue to support the dictator as long as the wealth is redistributed. 

Democracy and Growth

- As the economy becomes more developed, production becomes more based on joint and complex work. 
- Primitive economies rely generally on simple and solo work
- Industrial economies are skill and capital intensive, but they do not come from the same source. The elites provide the capital, while the poor provide skilled labour.
- These elites rely on the workers and oftentimes cannot force workers to work. Workers can purposely put in low effort, sabotage, petty theft, playing dumb, etc.
- As a state becomes more democratized, this type of resistance becoming more damaging
- Thus the elites offer concessions (redistribution and concessions) to the workers.
- Example: King vs. council in Europe.
- Before industrialization: the revenue of the king came mostly from the land. 
- They did not rely on poor to generate income. No reason to share income with poor, and thus no reason to transfer power to the poor. The economy was not based on joint production, and thus it was an absolute monarchy.
- As the economy grew, production replaced land as key source of revenue
- Thus, the elites became more dependent on taxing the population to generate income. 
- The crown borrowed money from the population without repayment. 
- To get revenue, crown had to induce cooperation of public. The crown thus offered the population the power to redistribute income and also more political power. 
- Thus, the king ceded power to a separate council – democracy evolves. 
- Thus, democracy emerged
- The effect of industrialization of the strategy of poor: 
- financial capital is more mobile than land
- as financial capital gains importance due to industrialization, the exit of elite support becomes too costly for growth
- Thus, if pressured, the elites will flee with their money
- thus, the poor do not wish to demand too much income redistribution from the elites.
- In response, elites would be willing to meet the demand of the poor
- Democracies often fail in highly unequal societies
- Failure stems from elite/poor redistributive conflicts
- Elites are unwilling to redistribute
- Poor demand too much redistribution
- Thus, the elites use repression at all cost as the price of conceding to the poor is too high. 
- Industrialization softens these redistributive conflicts
- Industrialization makes joint work more important for growth
- The elites require cooperation of the door
- Thus, they become more willing to redistribute.
- The poor also becoming willing to demand less, as they fear the elites will flee with their goods, as it is easier in an industrialized country to flee with capital
- Thus, redistribution and democratization become easier to achieve. 
- Industrialize can foster democracy in highly unequal societies
- US example: the south was highly autocratic. Why?
- Western regions: egalitarian, and thus democratic
- Northeast, Midwest – unequal income, but industrial area -> democratic
- Southeast – unequal and rural and thus autocratic.
- We can see from the example of the Midwest and northeast that although unequal, industrialization allowed for democracy.
