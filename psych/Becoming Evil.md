# Becoming Evil

## Mind over Matter Principle(MioMa)

- "I don't mind, you don't matter"
- individuals will engage in "evil" behaviour if **there is expected net benefit to self/ingroup, outweighing expected costs to victims**

### Derivations

#### You don't matter *enough*

#### Not mattering  

action or *inaction* - neglect /overlook concerns  i.e. leaving a child in hot summer car seat. no need to be directly responsible for the harm, as long as people perceive them having misplaced priority

#### Expected cost != actual

- **victims**: ignored, minimized, justified

- **perpetrators**: awareness of possible costs to self+ perceived likelihood of costs
  - **the disconnect b/w the perceived cost and actual cost**, "America's dumbest criminals"

  - Ariely& Loewenstein(2006): sexual attitudes- same participants answer questions in normal state and aroused state. When respondents are aroused 1. less positive attitude towards contraception 

    - **motivation can create "tunnel vision"** -ex. what addicts are wiling to do for the next high

  - **the perceived ability to manage potential costs**
    * interpersonal: "evil personality"(Peck)-> scapegoating.  They are doing harmful things but also deflecting responsibility. 

    * organizational: "negative externality" -> deflect costs. "Let's dump it into the water and let others worry about it"

    * managing costs can feel rewarding. Lammers& Maner(2016): higher the occupational status more likely to engage in infidelity, despite having more to lose. The rush of outsmarting others.

### MioMa triggers - Chasing feelings

**"If I do A, then B will happen. If B happens, then I will *feel* more of C/less of D"**

* B-> C/D may not be consciously articulated.

* actor's perspective =/= other's perspective

  * i.e. going to prison, maybe it's better than sleeping on the streets?

#### B->C: anticipated positive states

  * self-expansion, whatever the cost to others, like cancer

    * example: the travel agent creates fake ticket, call in da bomb threat at the airport 
    * example: the tube prankster.
    * example: the pro assassin(Shlesinger,2001) - tears up when he talks about his family, "it may not be the right way but my only way. I need to provide for my family sending children to private school"

  * Eliminating goal blockers: common feeling is anger

    * example: contract killings(Mouzos& veditto): in Australia 1/3 of the cases are related to "I want to be with someone so I need to get rid of the other person"
    * example: road rage

#### B-> D (anticipated relief from negative state)

example: simple annoyance(Mouzos& veditto)

##### Fear

response to threat, motivate us to deal with the threat. "run" or neutralize the threat. 

* example: "preemptive strike"(Simunovic)- choose to press the button or not. press the button with cash incentive where neither of you press the button

##### **Disgust** 

**rejection or purification**, the need to purge the physical or moral **contamination**. 

* example: "wet wipes for the soul"(Ritter&Preston) religious Christians rate lemons more disgusting after looking at atheist manifesto, but physically wipes their hands eliminated the reaction
* example: "poisonous Western fizz"(Bloody Cartoons) 
* **disgust sensitivity** -> less aggression & nastiness. "I'd rather not engage", but if it is the "cause" of disgust -> target of nastiness
  * Set up arbitrary ingroup, outgroup, exposed to images. When it comes to disgusting images, there is a distinct ingroup/outgroup bias
* disgust and anger are both responses to moral violations. 
  * when they see themselves as the **victim, anger** is the predominant response and leads to direct retaliation. 
  * When they **perceive the third party is a victim**, it leads to disgust and "coordinated condemnation". 
  * **Political speech + "disgust"-> violence**, disgust is a better predictor in violence to outgroup than anger.
* **AVOID if you can. ATTACK if you must. OUTSOURCING is best (good propaganda tool)** 

##### **Shame**

response to rejection,which is about trying to protect the **self**, "I am a mistake"
* in contrast to shame, guilt is a response to a behaviour, "I made a mistake, thus I feel motivated to fix that."
* public shaming-> humiliation -> Mark of Cain: "there is something wrong with you and everyone should know it"
* if people feel like they cannot escape the message, they harm others to deny helplessness, assert power
  * familicide(Webs): killings inside family
    * **livid coercive**: the perpetrator has a history of controlling behaviour, emotional/physical abuse in the family. the trigger is the impending loss of the relationship, usually self-inflicted since the perp is not treating people well.  "if I can't have you no one can"
    * **civil reputable**:  everything looks fine on the outside. "A gendered failure": a family with very stereotypical division of labour, a sense of "I've failed, I'm shamed, and I'm gonna save my family from furthur disgrace too" 

### Individual Differences

#### Some do... and SOME DONT

there is observable trend, but it does not mean it will happen to everyone

#### "The Dark Triad"

Descriptive, traits tend to **co-occur** and common core is" MioMa is a *LIFESTYLE*". It is a summary, not a cause. 

1. **psychopathy**: careless of other people
2. **Machiavellianism**: how to get the edge over others, cynical, low opinion of other people. Manipulative, tell people what they want to. Long con.
3. **narcissism**: grandiose

##### What's the engine?

* Desire for power/dominance and less interest in belonging. "It's risky to trust because it makes you vulnerable"
* **Appetite for "more"**: greed predicts fluctuations in dark triad indorsement overtime, making it a possible engine. Dark Triad=strategies and justification in service of appetite for "more". 
  * Where does this appetite comes from?  **Unpredictable, harsh environment**(Brumbach) - follows American teens over years, and witnessing violence and inadequate parental care predicts dark behaviours. It creates a **survivalist** worldview, "in stuff we trust since nobody else is here for you".

#### Shame sensitivity

* When "unpleasant" becomes "intolerable"
* **Abuse/trauma(implicating the SELF) -> PTSD -> shame processing bias** "you think I suck" - negative problem is not something to be solved, but something about the self **-> violence**, narcissistic personality disorder(boost yourself), borderline personality(unstable)
