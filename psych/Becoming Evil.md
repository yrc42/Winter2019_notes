# Becoming Evil

## Mind over Matter Principle(MioMa)

- "I don't mind, you don't matter"
- individuals will engage in "evil" behaviour if **there is expected net benefit to self/ingroup, outweighing expected costs to victims**

### Derivations

#### 1. You don't matter *enough*

#### 2. Not mattering  

* action or *inaction* - neglect /overlook concerns  i.e. leaving a child in hot summer car seat. no need to be directly responsible for the harm, as long as people perceive them having misplaced priority

#### 3. Expected cost != actual cost

- **victims**: ignored, minimized, justified

- **perpetrators**: awareness of possible costs to self+ perceived likelihood of costs
  - **the disconnect b/w the perceived cost and actual cost**, "America's dumbest criminals"

  - Ariely& Loewenstein(2006): sexual attitudes- same participants answer questions in normal state and aroused state. When respondents are aroused -> less positive attitude towards contraception 

    - **motivation can create "tunnel vision"** -ex. what addicts are wiling to do for the next high

  - **the perceived ability to manage potential costs**
    * **interpersonal**: "evil personality"(Peck)-> scapegoating.  They are doing harmful things but also deflecting responsibility. 

    * **organizational**: "negative externality" -> deflect costs. "Let's dump it into the water and let others worry about it"

    * **managing costs can feel rewardin**g. Lammers& Maner(2016): higher the occupational status more likely to engage in infidelity, despite having more to lose. The rush of outsmarting others.

### MioMa triggers - Chasing feelings

**"If I do A, then B will happen. If B happens, then I will *feel* more of C, less of D"**

* B-> C/D may not be consciously articulated.

* actor's perspective =/= other's perspective

  * i.e. going to prison, maybe it's better than sleeping on the streets?

#### B->C: anticipated positive states

  * **self-expansion**, whatever the cost to others, like cancer
    * example: the travel agent creates fake ticket, call in da bomb threat at the airport 
    * example: the tube prankster.
    * example: the pro assassin(Shlesinger,2001) - tears up when he talks about his family, "it may not be the right way but my only way. I need to provide for my family sending children to private school"

  * **Eliminating goal blockers**: willing to do anything for the goal, common feeling is anger
    * example: contract killings(Mouzos& veditto): in Australia 1/3 of the cases are related to "I want to be with someone so I need to get rid of the other person"
    * example: road rage

#### B-> D (anticipated relief from negative state)

example: simple annoyance(Mouzos& veditto)

##### 1. Fear

**response to threat**, motivate us to deal with the threat. "run" or neutralize the threat. 

* example: **"preemptive strike**"(Simunovic)- choose to press the button or not. press the button with cash incentive where neither of you press the button

##### **2. Disgust** 

**rejection or purification**, the need to purge the physical or moral **contamination**. 

* example: "wet wipes for the soul"(Ritter&Preston) religious Christians rate lemons more disgusting after looking at atheist manifesto, but physically wipes their hands eliminated the reaction
* example: "poisonous Western fizz"(Bloody Cartoons) 
* **disgust sensitivity** -> less aggression & nastiness. "I'd rather not engage", but if it is the "cause" of disgust -> target of nastiness
  * Set up arbitrary ingroup, outgroup, exposed to images. **When it comes to disgusting images, there is a distinct ingroup/outgroup bias**
* **disgust vs anger**:  are both responses to moral violations. 
  * when they see themselves as the **victim, anger** is the predominant response and leads to direct retaliation. 
  * When they **perceive the third party is a victim**, it leads to disgust and "coordinated condemnation". 
  * **Political speech + "disgust"-> violence**, disgust is a better predictor in violence to outgroup than anger.
* **AVOID if you can. ATTACK if you must. OUTSOURCING is best (good propaganda tool)** 

##### **3. Shame**

**response to rejection**,which is about trying to protect the **self**, "I am a mistake"

* in contrast to shame, **guilt is a response to a behaviour**, "I made a mistake, thus I feel motivated to fix that."
* **public shaming-> humiliation -> Mark of Cain:** "there is something wrong with you and everyone should know it"
* if people feel like they cannot escape the message, they harm others to deny helplessness, assert power
  * familicide(Webs): killings inside family
    * **livid coercive**: the perpetrator has a history of controlling behaviour, **emotional/physical abuse** in the family. the trigger is the impending loss of the relationship, usually self-inflicted since the perp is not treating people well.  "if I can't have you no one can"
    * **civil reputable**:  everything looks fine on the outside. **"A gendered failure**": a family with very stereotypical division of labour, a sense of "I've failed, I'm shamed, and I'm gonna save my family from furthur disgrace too" 

### Individual Differences

#### Some do... and SOME DONT

there is observable trend, but it does not mean it will happen to everyone

#### "The Dark Triad"

Descriptive, traits tend to **co-occur**, and common core is" MioMa is a *LIFESTYLE*". It is a summary, not a cause. 

1. **psychopathy**: careless of other people
2. **Machiavellianism**: how to get the edge over others, cynical, low opinion of other people. Manipulative, tell people what they want to. Long con.
3. **narcissism**: grandiose

##### What's the engine?

* **Desire for power/dominance and less interest in belonging.** "It's risky to trust because it makes you vulnerable"
* **Appetite for "more"**: greed predicts fluctuations in dark triad indorsement overtime, making it a possible engine. Dark Triad=strategies and justification in service of appetite for "more". 
  * Where does this appetite comes from?  **Unpredictable, harsh environment**(Brumbach) - follows American teens over years, and witnessing violence and inadequate parental care predicts dark behaviours. It creates a **survivalist** worldview, "in stuff we trust since nobody else is here for you".

#### Shame sensitivity

* When "unpleasant" becomes "intolerable"
* **Abuse/trauma(implicating the SELF)** -> 
  * **PTSD** ->
  * **shame processing bias** "you think I suck" - **negative problem is not something to be solved, but something about the self** -> 
  * **violence**, narcissistic personality disorder(boost yourself), borderline personality(unstable)

## Hate

### WHAT IS HATE?

- **Hate is a MOTIVE**. Motives involve goals. Hate is about the intent to harm, diminishing the well-being of the other.(What is love? Perserving and promoting the well-being of the other). **Love and Hate are both motives, not feelings.**
- Motives are **THERMOSTATIC**. Stay on until it hits that set point and then it turns off. Switch on, goal done, switch off.
- Hate is frowned upon. You can fantasize about it, but you won't do it. **Hate is gonna stay stable because it stays switched on.**
- Instrumental or ultimate goals - Something can be a means to an end or an end in itself. Different types of hate. **REDRESS** - revenge-oriented hate. It is a means to an end to restore order. **TETHERING** - willing to hurt somebody in order to keep them close so they don't abandon you
- .Altruistic love is an end in itself. Hate is not an emotion, but it can be triggered by emotions.

###  HOW DO WE KNOW?

#### The Prototype Study

How would you define hate? 200-something responses → 50 statements. Then to what degree does this capture hate as you. A 1 to 7 scale.

| motive to harm | "strong" emotion                 | "weak" emotion                  |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
|                | intense emotions - disgust, etc. | agitation, irritation, jealousy |
| 4.84 >         | 4.02 >                           | 2.56                            |

**Desire to harm == hate. Emotion is not irrelevant, but not as important.**

#### The "Thought Quote" Study

If you were inside a person's head. How much these thought quotes capture hate.

Winner: "I want to hurt him. Period." [5.99] 

**You just have to want them to be hurt.** "I don't want him to be hurt" → "That's not hate."

### Thus...

1. People may have trouble spontaneously defining hate - **they do not focus on intent to harm right away.** They **focus on the emotions**. 
2. But... they know it when they see it.
3. Still, they have to "see it" to "know it".

- Word-completion tasks: HA_E. Neutral and Religious [28%]. Evil [49%]. There is an **implicit cognitive link between evil and hate.**
- Cain and Able - God makes him a social outcast. Cain: "My punishment is greater than I can bear." **Cain intentionally harmed his brother.** When we label someone as evil, it's like labelling them with "the Mark of Cain". Toxic and stigmatizing.
- **Hate = "evil" minus justification**
- If you're going to hate somebody, you better damn well have it justified. **Haters should be motivated to self-justify. If we do not, we end up in the situation where we are fitting the "evil" prototype.**

### IF HATING IS TOXIC...

- **1st line of defense: simple denial?** > "I just intensely dislike them." People deny instead of admitting that they hate.
- **2nd line of defense: "populist normalizing"?** > "Everybody makes mistakes." People say that everyone would hate them too.
  - Charles Manson: How can you condemn me, I'm just a reflection of you.

### Class Data

a) **manipulate accessibility of "Hidden Observer"** - "Have you ever hated anybody?" Hidden Observer is like a Dr.Phil

b**) manipulate salience of social judgement** - Before asked whether or not you've ever hated anybody. Half did a thing on rewards on being good, half did a thing on being bad.

c) examine effects on admissions of hate and framing one's experience as commonplace.

- Hidden Observer > No Hidden Observer. **71% admitted hating anybody. 87% with a Hidden Observer.** **If people aren't getting pushed, they deny.**The Hidden Observer is a part of ourselves that knows all that is going on. Once it was brought online, it was easier to admit to hating someone. 
- Social judgement was manipulated.**Rewards turned down social threat (HO didn't matter). Costs turned social threat up**. **Costs + No HO = don't need to justify myself. Costs + HO = need to defend myself.**

### AN EASY WAY TO JUSTIFY HATE IS TO...

- **Label the hated "EVIL". It's okay to hate evil.**
  - Endless cycle: Hate begets "evil," which begets hate, which begets "evil"...
  - Easiest way to not see myself is evil is to see you as evil. They don't want that label, they're going to see you as evil.

- **Deflecting- label the hate as love**
  - Henton et all(1983)-high school couples, motivation?
    - Abusers:  54% angry, 60% confused, 3%hate, 31%love
    - Abused: 71% angry, 59% confused, 4%hate, 27%love
  - Dunn(1999)-stalking
    - "no contact" ex shoes up with flowers or gifts
    - flattered(and frightened) <-> "love" and mayhem
- **Justified Admission**: "I hate X because X is EVIL"
- **Normalized Admission**: "Yes I hate, but we all hate. Hate happens"
  - subliminal prime "I hate" very clear pattern where they are more likely to engaged in normalized admission, comparing with other primes 
  - "You would, too/I'm no worse than you." 

* "Real" hate... **doesn't require action, it can simply require the desire of wanting the target to suffer.** Hate is not always a eventuated behaviour, but without hate the action will not happen
* why "hate"?
  * chasing a feeling(MioMa)

## Sadism

### What's sadism?

It's **an instrumental form of hate**, by **harming other**(physical, psychological), and **ultimate goal: positive effect for self**

* if the want is here, whether or not they act upon it or if there is payoff, is still sadism
* "want" without the pursuit of positive emotional goal is not sadism
* coerced harmful behavior - "I need to do this because I'm under threat" is not sadism
* "harming" to gratify target is not sadism - genuine sadism will deny harming others if they enjoy being hurt 
* thus sadism is a luxury

### Is sadism evil?

* part of the **MOPE**
* **LEAST acceptable justification**
* **the ultimate MioMa**- "I'm willing to harm you for the lel" -> Mark of Cain
* **assert invulnerability or** minimize/justify
  * "I am so badass that I can admit I'm sadistic. What are you gonna do?"

### Who "isn't" sadistic?

* intimate partner violence: perps and victims(Neal&Edwards,2017) - of all the reasons of motivations, sadism is not listed by neither abusers nor victims.

* Arriaga(2002):"joking" about intimate partner violence 

* **it's hard for people to live with, so victims avoid going there -**as "SADISM" IS A DEALBREAKER 

### Sadism as an individual difference

* **dark triad + (dispositional) sadism = "DARK TETRAD"** 
  * descriptive summary: lots of nasty correlates

### What does sadism feel like?

* hearing stranger's severe injury, crushing defeat -> schadenfreude(sadistic emotions like satisfying,enjoyable) 
* reading story about perps attempt harm -> sadists "joy" -> gives lenient moral judgement
* violent scenes->"positive"; peaceful/joyful ->"negative"
* **unrelated to emotional instability, linked to expressive suppression**(control my emotions by controlling their expression, emotional poker face)

### Why sadistic motivation?

1. Perceived **insults** to the self
2. (nonconscious) motivation to **restore** the self
3. **displaced** intent to harm - not striking back at people who insulted me, but at others
4. (Temporary) **elevation** of self, positive emotional payoff

#### Evidence for the model?

##### Boosting the self via pranking?

* **disrespect sensitivity + anger rumination (DSAR)**
  * predicts dispositional sadism and 
  * prank-related: sadistic thoughts, positive emotions, justifications, desire to prank again

##### Boosting the self via watching pranks?

* disrespect sensitivity+ anger rumination 
  * predicts dispositional sadism and 
  * sadistic motivation, self-elevation/victim derogation - **IMPORTANT: only when long-term harm is likely**

### Sadism's Great "Disconnect"

1. **"tunnel vision"-> "harmful fun"** : i.e. "birthday prank would be hilarious"
2. **conscious goal v. nonconscious trigger**: "I'm not feeling hateful, I just feel giddy" but there is simmering hate underneath. **Address DSAR-> defuse sadism**. i.e. Daddy-O Five

**The motivational structure is the same regardless if it is a cake in face or torture chamber**

# Serial Killer

For most people, what would it take for most people to kill?

1. perceived **threat** - to lessen the negative D
2. perceived **alternatives inadequate**/ exhausted

Serial Killers are not most people: most of C

## What is a serial killer?

* minimum: 2 motivationally distinct murders
* **motive: "personal gratification"** - does financial benefit counts? they could also misrepresent motivation

### person or protagonists?

Getting good data is difficult. Obstacles:

1. **adequacy of sample**: increasingly rare, peaked in 1987, hard to gain access( dead, not caught)
2. **accuracy of data**: self-report reliance, some may exaggerate the body count or deny 
3. **attitudes** toward SKs: 
   * **bogeyman**: distraction, exaggerated threat - massive fear 
   * **antihero/celebrity**: trivializes victims' suffering
   * **mythology obscures motivation**
     * "incomprehensible" = "insane"? legally few claim it and fewer wins, less than 40% actually have disorder
     * "expectations of a monster" : what to do with the mundane and the prosocial?

## Why are serial keillers?

**There are no "one-size-fits-all" recipe**

1. **more remote in time = less predictive** i.e. 10% of SKs have head injury, way above baseline, but many people with head injury does not become SKs
2. SKs are **heterogeneous**: women(15%), non-violent(poisoning), non-sexual

### Sks as sadism's most extreme?

* "deviant leisure": killing for fun, compare big game hunting - hunting humans
* Classification based on Holmes& Holmes - men 96% fall in top3 category, women 73%
  1. **Hedonistic: excitement, comforts**
  2. **Power/Control: satisfaction**
  3. **Mission: pride**
  4. **Visionary: psychosis**

* **displaced aggression?** YES
  * case study: Elizabeth Wettlaufer - Ontario nurse, minimum 8 deaths, 2007-2016, confessed during hospitalization due to suicidal tendency, she got reassigned to monitor school children
  * **"red surge"-> harm->"the laughter"**: anger at job, life and relationship. felt put upon, provoked, multiple justifications(P/C or visionary). not psychotic, not legally insane, not an outlier
    * talks about pranking the nursing staff
  * many female SKs work in health industry

## How are serial killers?

* same menu of deflection strategies 
  * minimize  harm? not really
  * decreased perceived intent? sometimes
  * **invoke justifications? YES** - "I was abused by mommy so I will abuse this woman that looks like her"
  * **asserting power/invulnerability: YES** - "I am beyond this all"
