# What is Evil

## Evil is a label 
- Labeling is a way to organize/interpret raw information, fundamental to our perception. 
- Labelling always has a consequence, a reaction. Different labels have different properties.
- - **Descriptive**
  - **Category-defining**: evil is either you are or you are not, it's categorical, not numerical
  - - **Tajfel**: presented a series of lines with categorization condition vs no categorization condition. It's observed that when a line is categorized with other longer lines, people perceive it longer as well.
  - **Evaluative**: there is value behind this label
  - **Explanatory**: there is underlying reason/cause for this label. Ie. Sick as label has disease as reason
- When and how do people use other labels?
- - Prototype: a mental extraction, average of the features of object that belongs in a certain category. It centers on the common stuff.
  - The fewer the features match , the more hesitant we may be to apply the label

### **Prototype of evil behaviour** 
**harm **that is **intentionally **produced and judged to be **unjustifiable **
   - victim focus, severity/extremity matters
   - perpetrator focus, repetition matters
   - perceiver focus, perspective matters - often the most hotly disputed
#### Empirical Support for the 3-feature Prototype
- "incomprehensible" forensic patients are evil -> perceived justification
- "Eichmann(nazi war criminal) isn't evil if ...."
- killing home intruders are less evil -> perceived justification
- intent, severity of harm, age of victim all affect evilness. When the victim is a child, it is perceived to be more evil overall 

##### Can animal be evil? 
  - "Wile E Coyote effect" where the perpetrator is a screwup - shift from ëvil to pathetic
  - what about Real animals?

#### Four Salient Feature by Govrin
Evil as a prototype - what Govrin think is missing
- Firstly, Gromet et al. (2016) found that an observer who takes pleasure in the suffering of others will be judged evil even if he was not responsible for the victim's suffering. 
- Secondly, the characterization “perceived lack of justification” is insufficient. Severe negligence resulting in death or injury can also be judged as lacking justification but is not considered evil. Also, the perpetrator will have many justifications, considered by him to be valid, for having harmed the victim. Why, in so many cases, does the observer refuse to accept the perpetrator's explanations? Perceived lack of justification is too narrow a characterization to describe the huge cognitive discrepancy and emotional crisis between the observer and the perpetrator.
- these characterizations do not consider the power relations 
##### four salient features: 
- **Extreme asymmetry between victim and perpetrator**

- **perceived attitude of the perpetrator toward the victim's vulnerability;** 

- - In some cases, the victim's vulnerability fails to arouse his concern, in others it even causes the aggressor to attack and injure him -*disturbs the observer, who judges the perpetrator and leads to the collapse of basic dyadic expectations*, namely, that harming the dependent and weak is morally unacceptable and constitutes an act of evil. 

- **the observer's inability to understand the perpetrator's perspective** 

- - The perpetrator's motives appear senseless to the observer - intentionally sadistic way, with a desire to harm, or displaying moral indifference. 

- - - Because the observer is identified with the dyadic rules this lack of correspondence is interpreted by him as the perpetrator's intention to act against our basic values and its catastrophic ruin of our moral matrix.
    - we don't know why people do genocide: They are more likely to engage in destructive acts if: 1.Groups share a sense of both superiority and insecurity;2. have a history of devaluing others and aggressive behavior; 3.are more oriented to obey authority; 4.their culture is monolithic rather than pluralistic. 
    - match the principles of the theory-theory, but not those included in the simulation theory*. We understand the moral failure without reference to our own selves and feelings. We are unable to perceive an analogy between how we think and act and this particular terrible deed. It seems that we engage in comparing our mind to those of the perpetrators and only on this basis we feel we can't understand it.

- **The Aggressor's Refusal to Accept Responsibility for His Deeds**

- - from the observer's point of view, the most problematic aspect of the situation is the fact that the perpetrator's action manifestly violated the rules of the dyad, the most blatant violation being the aggressor's refusal to recognize dependency / vulnerability as worthy of protection. That not only turns the aggressor into a dangerous and inhumane person but also undermines the observer's world view
  - If the aggressor expresses sincere regret and is prepared to pay a price for his misdeed, compatibility between observer and aggressor could be reinstated. 
  - the perception of evil is reinforced if the aggressor refuses to alter his stance. 
    - both deniers and admitters are responsible for significant moral failures: Deniers are responsible for not acknowledging the dyad as a whole: They do not seem to grasp the asymmetry of force between them and the victim. Admitters are responsible for their refusal to recognize that what they did cannot be justified and is morally inexcusable. The perception of evil comes as a response to the second moral failure no less seriously than it does to the first.

  - personality factors which influence the judgment of an act of evil: Individuals who more strongly believe in pure evil (who score higher on the BPE scale) exhibit a more antisocial/aggressive orientation toward others. Such individuals believe that the world is a viler, more dangerous place and report more aggressive (vs. peaceful) attitudes, from matters of foreign policy to the criminal justice system.


##### cognitive bias:
The observer is almost always mistaken in his attributions of a certain state of mind to the perpetrator.

- If people would perceive evildoers in an “objective” way, taking the perpetrator's perspective into account, they would probably be in danger.  the perception of evil involves fear: It signals an existential threat. 

#####  other notes
- cultural differences in relation to moral values do not necessarily cancel out the agreement that exists between people in relation to the perception of evil.

- Recent views of the operation of the mind support this more disorderly and more dynamic view of how judgments are formed.

- prototypical models forecast human cognition more accurately than do paradigms based on the “if-then models” 


##### Criticism of Govrin (2018)

- conflates evil behaviour with evil person

- portrays perceived lack of justification too narrowly, ie negligience

- 3 feature prototype subsumes four salient feature

- - victim-perpetrator asymmetry: the easier to inflict harm
  - perp's attitude towards victim's vulnerability
  - perp's mind is inaccessible to observer
  - perp's refusal to accept responsibility: the only hope for perp to not be labeled as evil is to  let go of the need to justify


### Implication of the evil prototype
- Evil is never a given, is not objective
- Evil can appear in everyday context
- subjectivity creates tension


## What makes an evil doer?

### definition

Evil doers are people who do evil deeds. Once an individual is labeled as evil doers, we attribute evil deeds to that person/entity. It sets up the future expectation.

**fundamental attribution error**

- Self: intentional harm + external attributions(i.e. situation) -> "what I did wasn't evil" -> I am not evil
- others: intentional harm + no external attributions-> "what you did was evil" -> because YOU are evil

### Invisible evil doers?

Three necessary conditions

1. **harm-causing event**: negative events grab our attention more than positive event as it has more implication on our survival 

2. ***known* naturalistics causes insufficient**: dependent on individual. We are hard-wired to assume there are intention(unseen agent's act) behind harm, other than "shit-happens"

3. do we see the unseen agent's act **unjustifiable**? if yes, evil spirits

   i.e. Old Testament God kills well-intentioned people. Writer takes God's side and portrays as if God's anger was justified. If God's act is unjustifiable, then God is capable of evil. Since God isn't then God must have a reason, or God didn't do it (evil spirit).

#### The Myth of Pure Evil -MOPE(Baumeister)

##### Six key components

1. **"Evil" = intentional harm and in the eye of beholder** (fits the 3 feature prototype)
2. **pure evil opposes order, peace, and stability**
3. **pure evil is sadistic**: harming people for pleasure is the worst justification
4. **targets of pure evil are innocent and good**: i.e. say nice things about victims of mass shooting 
5. **pure evil is "the enemy"**: we don't want to see ourselves as evil. It's costly
6. **pure evil is "unchangeable"**: born bad, pass the point of no return
   - set behavioural expectations: hard to imagine the mundane stuff done by serial killers
   - irredeemable: no treatment, urge to erase the evil doer

##### Three MOPE Examples

##### The Thick Slice Hypothesis 

One evil deed is enough if **perpetrator Intentionality + victim suffering -> Thick Slice of Time**

- i.e. very long pre-mediation period, repeated behaviour
- i.e. if it causes long-term irreversible harm

#### Moral Vitalism: Seeing Good and Evil as Real, Agentic Forces

##### The Nature of Moral Vitalism

Moral vitalism is similar to the invisible evil "spirit", observed in traditional belief, early scientific theorizing, children's understanding of biology and psychological events. They extend it by 

1.   First, moral vitalism refers to a belief in moral forces that are not necessarily embodied in objects or people. Previous research has tended to locate forces, energies, or essences within biological entities
2. Second, by examining such magical beliefs within the moral domain, we focus on cases where causal forces or essences are dichotomized.  “black and white,” 
3. people are more sensitive to the influence of the forces of evil than the forces of good. 

##### Moral Vitalism and Moral Judgment 

##### Study 1 

*  615 Australian undergraduate students  to respond to 16 items that we developed to tap beliefs about good and evil
* demonstrate that moral vitalists see good and evil as real 

Moral vitalism items

1.  There are underlying forces of good and evil in this world
2.  Either the forces of good or the forces of evil are responsible for most of the events in the world today
3.  The forces of good and evil often motivate human behavior
4.  People need to be aware of the good and evil that are in this world today
5.  Good and evil are aspects of the natural world 

##### Study 2

* 208 North Americans
* Moderate relationships between moral vitalism and both conservatism and religiosity , most strongly associated with strong opinion, linked to objectify good and evil and moral certainty.independent of the need for cognition. Finally, there was a weak relationship with gender
*  moral vitalism is largely unrelated to cognitive ability, but consistent with previous (and current) findings for a tendency to believe in supernatural agents (i.e., religiosity), it is related to reduced analytic thinking.

##### Study 3

spirit possession 

##### Study 4

increased feelings of disgust at the thought of having indirect or secondary contact (through the consumption of contaminated food) with immoral others

##### Study 5

 we examined whether moral vitalists may be especially threatened by having impure thoughts and whether they would seek to avoid such thoughts by implementing strategies for controlling them. when moral vitalists experience intrusive impure thoughts, they are especially prone to conclude that these thoughts have been influenced by the forces of good or evil.
