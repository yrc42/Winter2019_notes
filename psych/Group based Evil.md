# Group based Evil

* groups: **elective**(chosen) vs **inherited**(born into)
* what is the individual's role in the group's evil? passive, active, by mere association with the group?
* group membership: survival benefits: psychological benefits, psychological costs->collective guilt/shame
  * when we see members of our group responsible for unjustified harm - EVIL definiton

## When my group does evil, I can...

1. distance my group from evil. accept the narrative of the perpetrator 
2. distance my group from bad apples. "my group doesn't suck so they are not real group members"
3. distance yourself from group

## How groups amplify evil

### Harm

1. additive: when there are bunch of people doing something harmful there is more harm than just a few people, simply due to number.
2. exponential: coordination

### Intentionality

* fuzzy personhood: inside an entity, who get held responsible? the leadership, the bad apples, everybody, nobody? i.e. corporations 

### Justification

similar to individuals

## Group setting #1: corporates/Bureaucratic corruption

* appetite for more(if profit is the only goal) + MioMa(the people that work for them, people receiving product, the general public)  -> the normalization of corruption

### The "Three Pillars"

#### institutionalization

"this is the way we actually do it"

1. (charismatic) leaders: tell a bullshit story to the public, and then reward the behaviour or ignore it inside the organization
2. selective organizational memory: "i'm just gonna go with it"
3. removal of decision point: keep members busy focusing on minor little tasks,"I'm just the button pusher" 

#### Rationalization

we need a way to feel better- the hardest rationalization is the first one

rationalizing ideologies: the organization themselves offer justifications

* 1-6: mark of Cain, 7,8 : MioMa

1. denial of injury - "isn't really a big deal, compare to other things, ..."
2. denial of victim 
3. denial of responsibility- "I'm just doing what i am paid to do" ,intent 
4. legality - "if it's not illegal it's not wrong - we do what we do within the law, so we are not bad"
5. metaphor of the ledger - moral licensing, "we do a lot of good, should compensate the bad stuff"
6. social weighting- populist "you are not in the position to judge me"
7. appeal to higher loyalties - "God", "I need to take care of my family"
8. refocusing attention - "the pay is great!"

#### Socialization

* moral microcosm: the worker do not feel the mark of Cain from the outside world. rewards are set up based on loyalty to the throne
* self-selection: individual priorities. corrupt corporations tend to be more homogenous in value
* "suicidally corrupt": so bad that if the outside find out the corporation will be gone
* whistleblowers: not viewed kindly inside the organization - questioning, reporting 
  * major automakers
  * CDN greenhouse gas emitter - "it's unfair! we the people know climate change isn't real"
  * French alcohol/tobacco producers - "we are encouraging responsible use, we are so regulated we can't be unethical", moral microcosm and legality
