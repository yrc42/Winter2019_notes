# Group based Evil

* groups: **elective**(chosen) vs **inherited**(born into)
* what is the individual's role in the group's evil? passive, active, by mere association with the group?
* group membership: survival benefits: psychological benefits, psychological costs->collective guilt/shame
  * when we see members of our group responsible for unjustified harm - EVIL definiton

## When my group does evil, I can...

1. distance my group from evil. accept the narrative of the perpetrator 
2. distance my group from bad apples. "my group doesn't suck so they are not real group members"
3. distance yourself from group

## How groups amplify evil

### Harm

1. additive: when there are bunch of people doing something harmful there is more harm than just a few people, simply due to number.
2. exponential: coordination

### Intentionality

* fuzzy personhood: inside an entity, who get held responsible? the leadership, the bad apples, everybody, nobody? i.e. corporations 

### Justification

similar to individuals

## Group setting #1: corporates/Bureaucratic corruption

* appetite for more(if profit is the only goal) + MioMa(the people that work for them, people receiving product, the general public)  -> the normalization of corruption

### The "Three Pillars"

#### institutionalization

"this is the way we actually do it"

1. **(charismatic) leaders:** tell a bullshit story to the public, and then reward the behaviour or ignore it inside the organization
2. **selective organizational memory:** "i'm just gonna go with it"
3. **removal of decision point:** keep members busy focusing on minor little tasks,"I'm just the button pusher" 

#### Rationalization

* we need a way to feel better- the hardest rationalization is the first one

* rationalizing ideologies: the organization themselves offer justifications

* 1-6: mark of Cain, 7,8 : MioMa

  1. denial of injury - "isn't really a big deal, compare to other things, ..."
  2. denial of victim 
  3. denial of responsibility- "I'm just doing what i am paid to do" ,intent 
  4. legality - "if it's not illegal it's not wrong - we do what we do within the law, so we are not bad"
  5. metaphor of the ledger - moral licensing, "we do a lot of good, should compensate the bad stuff"
  6. social weighting- populist "you are not in the position to judge me"
  7. appeal to higher loyalties - "God", "I need to take care of my family"
  8. refocusing attention - "the pay is great!"

#### Socialization

* **moral microcosm**: the worker do not feel the mark of Cain from the outside world. rewards are set up based on loyalty to the throne

* **self-selection**: individual priorities. corrupt corporations tend to be more homogenous in value

* **"suicidally corrupt"**: so bad that if the outside find out the corporation will be gone

* **whistleblowers:** not viewed kindly inside the organization - questioning, reporting 


#### Examples
* major automakers
* CDN greenhouse gas emitter - "it's unfair! we the people know climate change isn't real"
* French alcohol/tobacco producers - "we are encouraging responsible use, we are so regulated we can't be unethical", moral microcosm and legality
* "War for survival"

## Group setting #2: Genocide

### Rwanda: the last just man

* UN did not want to send too many soldiers to Rwanda, lacking resources
* "you are with the hutus like we(colonizer) with you"
* government staging false flag attack
* children have no id card but forced to sit separately
* the state refuse to call it genocide because it forces action - how many acts of genocide is genocide?

### Properties

* harm and intention clear: massive amount of death and preparation - thus, only good enough justification

#### Common Factors(Staub 2012)

##### Leaders 

* **identify target group** - finding the scapegoat
* **sell "solution" to citizens** - this is what propaganda is about. Sell them with the idea that this solution deals with past grievances, and to prevent future threats. for example, in Rwanda Hutus consider it a payback. Sometimes eye for an eye becomes an overkill - wipe them out to prevent revenge

##### Citizens

* **takes it personally** - thinks about how themselves have been mistreated
* **respect authority** - increase the likelihood of buying in
* **accepts permission**

##### Together

* **"we feeling"** - a big focus on the ingroup, feel connected to the group they are part of.  
* **weak opposition** - "it could not be too bad, since no one is standing in our way. If you don't care enough to get into my way, I'll keep pushing it." i.e. Rwanda with the resistance army, wherever the resistance arrive, the genocide stops

#### Division of Labour 

* makes it easier. People need to be trained to massacre right. 

##### Roles (hollows&Fritzon,2012)

* looked at the court documents from people accused of war crimes in Balkan and looked into their roles
* **logistic** - career government/military people, coming from a higher society. They focus on the infrastructure to assist the genocide
* **sadistic** - less educated, less stable, the individuals that are lower status and are struggling more.  Feeling marginalized and disrespected. Process orientated -  want to make victims suffer during the process, using non-lethal weapon, sexual assault & humiliate victims

##### Methods(Rauxloh)

* massacre is "**necessary but inefficient**" - it's not just about how to kill people efficiently

* animosity is not enough of a reason - **must overcome physiological confrontational barrier**

  * via "**emotional energy dominance**" - enemies are weak and our group is strong - boosting themselves at the expense of others - similar to sadism
  * **acting on the perception gives a positive rush**
  * **preceded by symbolic attacks** - graffiti on properties, sacred places, if no one push back they go bigger(ANTIFA FUCK YEAAH) 
  * **humiliation/desecration** - "before I kill you, force you do humiliating things - sex act, killing games, plead and bargain" - to keep up the **"Triumphant atmosphere"** such that the high/giddiness stay on

##### Explaining Oneself (Bryant 2017) - Rwanda

* It's "war", not genocide 
* distancing themselves is more commonly used as excuse than justifications - since they are already on trial, justification is useless
* "I am not capable of doing that. I'm nobody" - The most common defense, FAKE NEWS defense
* Functions : try to evade, assert goodness to avoid the Mark of Cain

##### Explaining Manyself

* general resistance to collective guilt & amends
  * situational pressures
  * outgroup deserved it
  * distance ME from the group
  * resistance among bystanders'kin, too

### Propaganda: Giving evil a face

- What's the enemy really like
- What EMOTIONS are relevant
- Is the enemy always HATED
- Is the enemy always EVIL

Anger - We get angry at other people when they block our goal. The movement of self is towards other, and the other pushes back(self-><-other)

Disgust - A rejection response to protect body from contamination, the self is pushing other away and down

Fear - Other is coming at self - a direct , active threat, and the fear's response is to avoid

Hate  - The motive to harm the others, powered by anger, disgust, and fear

**Propaganda's goal is to invoke anger, disgust, and fear to trigger hate**


| "face"            | Emotions                                                     | Hated?                                                       | Evil?                       | Examples                                     |

| Human (like ME)   | "healthy respect"- even though we have differences, assume you're reasonable just like me | No -"do you yield?", minimize harm                           | No                          | worthy opponent                              |
| Barely Human      | anger, symbolic disgust - contamination of the soul, moral  - i.e. Disgusted grandma in church "they are messing up my world" | YES                                                          | YES - intentionality        | MOPE 1 - sadistic                            |
| Sub- Human        | fear, core disgust - physical contamination                  | YES                                                          | NO - lack of intentionality | animal, disease - i.e. "senseless beast"     |
| Not Living        | lack of empathy - no connection to abstraction               | No* - I don't feel the need to destroy them but I'm ok with others doing it | No - no intentionality      | abstraction, labels, numbers on the chart    |
| Not of this world | anger, fear, disgust x2                                      | YES                                                          | YES                         | MOPE 2-demons, incarnations of absolute evil |

## Group Setting #3 -family

* small is not necessarily less corrupt
* greatest harm -> vulnerable/dependent

### Child Sexual Abuse and the Family

* Malloy (2007) - 400 US cases

  * the majority of perpetrator are relatives/parent

  * Nearly 1/4 recanted, took back accusation, despite compelling evidence

  * Especially likely to recant if (1) **the perpetrator is a parent figure (2)the non-offending caregiver failed to support victim** (i.e. blamed the child, stayed romantically involved with the perp)
* Reid(2015): 92 US youth sex trafficking cases
  * nearly 1/3 trafficker was a relative, pimping out kids for drug money
  * most others parent figure knew about it - passive bystanders

### Elder Abuse

* similar abuse, similar threats, PLUS financial abuse
* Over 1/2 perps are family - "strong sense of entitlement"

## Group-based Evil - Common Elements

1. MioMa - what I want is more important than others
2. Mark of Cain: two family examples - deny/conceal/justify OTHERS' deeds as well as one's own
3. division of labour: no role is too small
4. inconsistency across time& situation - "killer rescuers i.e. he attac he protec"
