# PSYCH EVIL Reading

## Four Salient Feature by Govrin

Evil as a prototype - what Govrin think is missing

- Firstly, Gromet et al. (2016) found that an observer who takes pleasure in the suffering of others will be judged evil even if he was not responsible for the victim's suffering. 
- Secondly, the characterization “perceived lack of justification” is insufficient. Severe negligence resulting in death or injury can also be judged as lacking justification but is not considered evil. Also, the perpetrator will have many justifications, considered by him to be valid, for having harmed the victim. Why, in so many cases, does the observer refuse to accept the perpetrator's explanations? Perceived lack of justification is too narrow a characterization to describe the huge cognitive discrepancy and emotional crisis between the observer and the perpetrator.
- these characterizations do not consider the power relations 

### four salient features

- **Extreme asymmetry between victim and perpetrator**
- **perceived attitude of the perpetrator toward the victim's vulnerability;** 
- - In some cases, the victim's vulnerability fails to arouse his concern, in others it even causes the aggressor to attack and injure him -*disturbs the observer, who judges the perpetrator and leads to the collapse of basic dyadic expectations*, namely, that harming the dependent and weak is morally unacceptable and constitutes an act of evil. 
- **the observer's inability to understand the perpetrator's perspective** 
- - The perpetrator's motives appear senseless to the observer - intentionally sadistic way, with a desire to harm, or displaying moral indifference. 
- - - Because the observer is identified with the dyadic rules this lack of correspondence is interpreted by him as the perpetrator's intention to act against our basic values and its catastrophic ruin of our moral matrix.
    - we don't know why people do genocide: They are more likely to engage in destructive acts if: 1.Groups share a sense of both superiority and insecurity;2. have a history of devaluing others and aggressive behavior; 3.are more oriented to obey authority; 4.their culture is monolithic rather than pluralistic. 
    - match the principles of the theory-theory, but not those included in the simulation theory*. We understand the moral failure without reference to our own selves and feelings. We are unable to perceive an analogy between how we think and act and this particular terrible deed. It seems that we engage in comparing our mind to those of the perpetrators and only on this basis we feel we can't understand it.
- **The Aggressor's Refusal to Accept Responsibility for His Deeds**
- - from the observer's point of view, the most problematic aspect of the situation is the fact that the perpetrator's action manifestly violated the rules of the dyad, the most blatant violation being the aggressor's refusal to recognize dependency / vulnerability as worthy of protection. That not only turns the aggressor into a dangerous and inhumane person but also undermines the observer's world view
  - If the aggressor expresses sincere regret and is prepared to pay a price for his misdeed, compatibility between observer and aggressor could be reinstated. 
  - the perception of evil is reinforced if the aggressor refuses to alter his stance. 
    - both deniers and admitters are responsible for significant moral failures: Deniers are responsible for not acknowledging the dyad as a whole: They do not seem to grasp the asymmetry of force between them and the victim. Admitters are responsible for their refusal to recognize that what they did cannot be justified and is morally inexcusable. The perception of evil comes as a response to the second moral failure no less seriously than it does to the first.
  - personality factors which influence the judgment of an act of evil: Individuals who more strongly believe in pure evil (who score higher on the BPE scale) exhibit a more antisocial/aggressive orientation toward others. Such individuals believe that the world is a viler, more dangerous place and report more aggressive (vs. peaceful) attitudes, from matters of foreign policy to the criminal justice system.

### cognitive bias

The observer is almost always mistaken in his attributions of a certain state of mind to the perpetrator.

- If people would perceive evildoers in an “objective” way, taking the perpetrator's perspective into account, they would probably be in danger.  the perception of evil involves fear: It signals an existential threat. 

### other notes

- cultural differences in relation to moral values do not necessarily cancel out the agreement that exists between people in relation to the perception of evil.
- Recent views of the operation of the mind support this more disorderly and more dynamic view of how judgments are formed.
- prototypical models forecast human cognition more accurately than do paradigms based on the “if-then models” 

### Criticism of Govrin (2018)

- conflates evil behaviour with evil person
- portrays perceived lack of justification too narrowly, ie negligience
- 3 feature prototype subsumes four salient feature
- - victim-perpetrator asymmetry: the easier to inflict harm
  - perp's attitude towards victim's vulnerability
  - perp's mind is inaccessible to observer
  - perp's refusal to accept responsibility: the only hope for perp to not be labeled as evil is to  let go of the need to justify

## Moral Vitalism: Seeing Good and Evil as Real, Agentic Forces

##### The Nature of Moral Vitalism

Moral vitalism is similar to the invisible evil "spirit", observed in traditional belief, early scientific theorizing, children's understanding of biology and psychological events. They extend it by 

1. First, moral vitalism refers to a belief in moral forces that are not necessarily embodied in objects or people. Previous research has tended to locate forces, energies, or essences within biological entities
2. Second, by examining such magical beliefs within the moral domain, we focus on cases where causal forces or essences are dichotomized.  “black and white,” 
3. people are more sensitive to the influence of the forces of evil than the forces of good. 

##### Moral Vitalism and Moral Judgment

##### Study 1

- 615 Australian undergraduate students  to respond to 16 items that we developed to tap beliefs about good and evil
- demonstrate that moral vitalists see good and evil as real 

Moral vitalism items

1. There are underlying forces of good and evil in this world
2. Either the forces of good or the forces of evil are responsible for most of the events in the world today
3. The forces of good and evil often motivate human behavior
4. People need to be aware of the good and evil that are in this world today
5. Good and evil are aspects of the natural world 

##### Study 2

- 208 North Americans
- Moderate relationships between moral vitalism and both conservatism and religiosity , most strongly associated with strong opinion, linked to objectify good and evil and moral certainty.independent of the need for cognition. Finally, there was a weak relationship with gender
- moral vitalism is largely unrelated to cognitive ability, but consistent with previous (and current) findings for a tendency to believe in supernatural agents (i.e., religiosity), it is related to reduced analytic thinking.

##### Study 3

spirit possession 

##### Study 4

increased feelings of disgust at the thought of having indirect or secondary contact (through the consumption of contaminated food) with immoral others

##### Study 5

 we examined whether moral vitalists may be especially threatened by having impure thoughts and whether they would seek to avoid such thoughts by implementing strategies for controlling them. when moral vitalists experience intrusive impure thoughts, they are especially prone to conclude that these thoughts have been influenced by the forces of good or evil.



# Demonic possession and deliverance in the diaspora

- 17 individuals participating in a **Pentecostal** deliverance ceremony and their descriptions of discerning demon possession, undergoing exorcism/deliverance, and their condition immediately following. 
- strong convergence on losing control in **nightmares**, which reflect adversity in their lives, which in turn reinforces the discernment. and accompanied by a lack of amnesia post-deliverance

## Phenomenological studies of demon possession and exorcism/deliverance 

*  absence of phenomenological descriptions of the experience of the possessed or of those individuals who perform the exorcism.  few studies which provide experiential descriptive accounts of the actual manifestation of possession, the resulting exorcism (or deliverance) and the individual’s own
* The importance of phenomenological accounts is that they can foremost assist with explicating the experiences of participants of these ceremonies which would lead to clearer distinctions in types of possession
*  contrast with phenomenological accounts of “positive” religious experiences to  reveal why times of stress can give rise to such divergent religious experiences in different individuals
* although they depart from the standard methodology
  * questioner is the evangelist rather than the researcher
  *  lack more speciﬁc or in-depth questioning
* but have same open-ended questioning and authentic and immediate account
